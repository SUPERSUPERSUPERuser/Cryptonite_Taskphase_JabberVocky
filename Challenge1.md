CHALLENGE 1 

1) Using bash hello
- Permission denied , does not allow me to see the contents of the flag file, cat flag is the command used

2) Changing directory
- Decided to use cd.. to explore the various files and directories

3) Finding Challenge file
- Decided to cd into a file named challenge

4) Noticing the bin file
- Tried to run bash hello here, still got a permission denied, so I must not have been in the right directory yet

5) trying ./hello
- Now it works!
